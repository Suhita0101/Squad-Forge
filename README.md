# ⚔️ Squad Forge

Squad Forge is a dynamic web app that allows users to create, customize, and manage their own team — or “squad.” Each crewmate has unique attributes and details, making it fun and interactive to build and track your dream team. Whether you’re imagining a gaming squad, a fantasy crew, or a development team, Squad Forge makes the experience intuitive and visually engaging.

✨ Features:
- 🧙‍♀️ Create Crewmates: Add new team members with a custom name and chosen attributes.
- 🧾 View All Crewmates: See all your added crewmates displayed on a summary page, sorted by most recent creation.
- ✏️ Edit Crewmates: Update a crewmate’s attributes directly from the summary or detail page — changes reflect instantly.
- 🗑️ Delete Crewmates: Remove any crewmate, and the list updates immediately.
- 🔗 Individual Detail Pages: Each crewmate has their own dedicated info page with more details and an edit option.
